I would like to rewrite the regression stuff to be more generic
in particular, it should have an optimization function that takes
two functions as inputs ($objective, $derivatives($number)) and
returns a maximum accordingly. That would allow the methods to
be genericized over different types of problems (say linear vs.
logistic).
