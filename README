Learning Library for PHP - some machine learning algorithms implemented in PHP
Copyright (C) 2011, 2012 Giuseppe Burtini <joe@truephp.com>

For effective use, a lot of this library will have to be customized. This is a
largely academic project. In many cases I've opted to write clearer code in favor
of faster code, and in other cases, I've excluded useful features for "real world"
applications (like training, saving the trained data to a file, and then running
the actual "estimates" after in a separate location).

If you would like to deploy this in a real world application, I would be happy
to work on it: contact me at joe@truephp.com.

Most of the code in this library is designed such that the rest of the library
can just be thrown away if you would like to use it. In parametric/ and unsupervised/
each "type" of learning is implemented in a file of its own (though, regression
stuff gets a whole directory!) so as to be useful without loading the rest of the
library.

There are many things that can be improved and there are many known properties (and
optimization techniques) that can be used to improve the performance of these
algorithms that have not been implemented here. This is very much a "first try" at
implementing a lot of these algorithms in PHP and should be looked at as a possible
starting point for learning algorithms in PHP, not necessarily a deployable library.

In many cases, the right answer will be to implement the learning algorithms in a
faster language and use PHP only to evaluate their probabilities / compute results
from the existing estimates.
